    <!-- Chosen Palette: Earthy Harmony -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The application is structured as a single-page dashboard with two main, switchable views: "Care Calendar" and "Plant Profiles & Troubleshooting". This task-oriented design was chosen over a linear report format for superior usability. Users can immediately select a plant and view its specific care schedule without scrolling through irrelevant information. The "Care Calendar" view uses a dropdown to filter content, presenting a focused look at the 4-week cycle and seasonal needs. The "Plant Profiles" view acts as an encyclopedia, using an accordion layout for quick access to troubleshooting tips. This interactive, non-linear structure allows users to quickly find answers to specific questions (e.g., "What do I do for my Rose in Week 2?") or explore in-depth information as needed, making the content far more accessible and practical for everyday use. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: Report Info: Weekly tasks (watering, fertilizing) & Seasonal needs -> Goal: Show care intensity over time -> Viz/Presentation: Interactive Bar Chart (Chart.js) -> Interaction: Updates when a new plant is selected from the dropdown -> Justification: A chart provides a quick, visual summary of how care needs (especially watering) change dramatically between seasons, which is more impactful and easier to grasp than text alone. Report Info: Troubleshooting symptoms and solutions -> Goal: Organize complex Q&A content -> Viz/Presentation: Accordion (HTML/JS) -> Interaction: Click to expand/collapse answers -> Justification: An accordion prevents overwhelming the user with a long wall of text, allowing them to focus only on the specific problem they are facing. This improves scannability and problem-solving efficiency. All other content is presented in dynamically updated HTML content blocks for clarity and responsiveness. -->
